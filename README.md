> ⚠️ **Note**: Lux is currently under heavy development and should be considered pre-alpha software. The API and architecture are subject to significant changes. We welcome feedback and contributions.

Lux is a powerful language-agnostic framework for building intelligent, adaptive, and collaborative multi-agent systems. It enables autonomous entities (Agents) to communicate, learn, and execute complex workflows while continuously improving through reflection.

## Why Lux?

- 🧠 **Self-Improving Agents**: Agents with built-in reflection capabilities (coming soon)
- 🚀 **Language Agnostic**: Build agents in your favorite programming language
- 🔄 **Type-Safe Communication**: Structured data flow with schema validation
- 🤖 **AI-First**: Deep LLM integration with advanced prompting and context management
- 🔌 **Extensible**: Easy integration with external services and APIs
- 📊 **Observable**: Built-in monitoring, metrics, and debugging tools
- 🧪 **Testable**: Comprehensive testing utilities for deterministic agent behavior

## Docker Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- Docker Compose (optional, for easier management)

### Using Docker

Lux provides a Docker setup for easy development and testing. This eliminates the need to manually install dependencies on your local machine.

#### Building the Docker Image

```bash
# Navigate to the Lux repository
cd lux

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t lux-dev .
```

#### Running the Container

```bash
# Run the container interactively
docker run -it --name lux_dev lux-dev

# Or using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it lux_dev bash
```

#### Running Tests Inside the Container

Once inside the container, you can run tests:

```bash
cd /workspace/lux
make test
```

The Docker environment comes with all necessary dependencies pre-installed, including:
- Erlang and Elixir (via asdf)
- Python with required packages (web3, nltk, eth-tester, py-evm)
- Node.js
- All system dependencies for development

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agents 👻
[Learn more about Agents](guides/agents.livemd)

Autonomous agents that combine intelligence and execution. Agents can:
- Monitor and analyze data
- Make strategic decisions
- Delegate tasks to other agents
- Adapt to changing conditions
- Collaborate through structured protocols

### 2. Signals 📡
[Learn more about Signals](guides/signals.livemd)

Type-safe communication using predefined schemas. Signals provide:
- Structured data validation
- Type safety across language boundaries
- Clear communication protocols
- Versioning and compatibility

### 3. Prisms 🔮
[Learn more about Prisms](guides/prisms.livemd)

Pure functional components for specific tasks. Prisms enable:
- Modular functionality
- Language-specific implementations
- Clear input/output contracts
- Easy testing and validation

### 4. Beams 🌟
[Learn more about Beams](guides/beams.livemd)

Composable workflow orchestrators. Beams allow you to:
- Define complex workflows
- Coordinate multiple agents
- Handle parallel execution
- Manage state and dependencies

## Language Support

Lux provides first-class support for multiple programming languages:

- **Python**: Deep integration with Python's scientific and ML ecosystem
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Frontend and Node.js support
- **Other Languages**: Language-agnostic protocols for easy integration
